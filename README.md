# Source Map Sharp

![Tests status](https://github.com/delneg/source-map-sharp/workflows/source-map-sharp-action/badge.svg?branch=master)
## About

This is a direct rewrite (meaning, the goal was not to write 'idiomatic' F# code, but to resemble inital JS code as close as possible) of source map generation tool https://github.com/mozilla/source-map

Which is originally written in JS. The initial purpose is to use it with https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable project

See https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/issues/2166 - "Bring back source map support"

UPD: The issue above was closed, and this project is now being used by Fable to generated Source Maps. Hooray!


### Running tests

dotnet:

`dotnet test`

Fable (js):
```
dotnet tool restore
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

3. SourceMapConsumer module
4. SourceMapNode, SourceMapGenerator - `consumer`-related tests


### Help needed

1. Source map consumer
2. Documentation & usage examples
3. Decisions on WASM stuff - Rust repo https://github.com/fitzgen/source-map-mappings
